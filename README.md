Joy-Wizard is a web application for employers to analyze the employees' well being.
I have used google firebase as the authentication manager, Spring boot as the backend,
React JS as the front end and MySQL as the database. Whenever an employee logs in
he'll be given a survey to take and multiple questions are asked and ratings and answers are recorded accordingly.
Employer is given the admin login where he can see the pie charts of each question and positive and negative 
ratings given by the employees accordingly.Employer can also add questions through the application.
This project I have done in just two days, and tried my best to complete it as much as possible and planning to implement more features later.
Thank you.
